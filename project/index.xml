      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning offers a promising methodology for developing robust robotic skills but typically results in independent control of specific behaviors. The common method is to urge robots to learn a target skill in an elaborately designed training setting. To further improve legged maneuverability, it is reasonable to combine such individual learned skills to attain novel and complex movements. Building on the previous success in legged locomotion with deep reinforcement learning techniques, we develop a hierarchical control method that separates high-level planning from low-level task fulfillments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a mobile manipulation setting, where the robot is asked to push a box to an given location. The learned policy specifies end-effector position targets relative to the robot base frame while driving the base towards the target object.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autonomous Pose Tracking with Compositional Reinforcement Learning Policies</title>

&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning offers a promising methodology for developing robust robotic skills but typically results in independent control of specific behaviors. The common method is to urge robots to learn a target skill in an elaborately designed training setting. To further improve legged maneuverability, it is reasonable to combine such individual learned skills to attain novel and complex movements. Building on the previous success in legged locomotion with deep reinforcement learning techniques, we introduce a compositional control structure that learns pose tracking skills using state and target frame descriptions as input, locomotion, and tilting commands and weights as output actions. We also prove the generality of this structure by showing trivial adaptations when migrated to a perceptive controller. Additional elements of our solution that contribute towards integrated behaviors include the elaborated reward design process and the use of a handcrafted controller as a baseline to reveal novel locomotion patterns. Results are demonstrated both in simulation and on a real legged platform based on the operation modes we develop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for Legged Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://tutunarsl.github.io/project/eth-forl/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-level tasks such as pose tracking for legged systems are important yet challenging topics in mobile navigation. In scenarios where only high-level objectives are specified, obtained skills can be directly used as independent low-level components that break away from the high-level controller design. In this work, the effectiveness of an RL-based controller is proved with a proposed hierarchical control structure for a quadrupedal system where a high-level target-commanded policy learns to utilize existing low-level locomotion skills to continuously navigate the robot to track given pose trajectories on open and flat terrain. Experiments on a locomotion alignment task on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anybotics.com/anymal-autonomous-legged-robot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ANYmal&lt;/a&gt; show that the functionality of the proposed RL-based controller is able to yield comparable tracking behaviors as a fine-tuned PD controller while providing additional safety guarantees and naturalness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to learn a policy to smoothly descend a lunar lander to the ground in between two flags with minimal fuel use and without collapsing. To this end, Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) is used to estimate actor and critic, respectively, while decreasing the variance of the policy gradient estimates and keeping them unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to predict groundwater pollution levels. To address the computational complexity associated with Gaussian Process models due to the large dataset, the Nyström approximation of the kernel function and inducing points method are applied. The kernel type and hyperparameters are tuned and learned during training. To handle the asymmetric cost, the prior mean is set to a non-trivial value. In this way, the possibility of underestimating the pollution value is reduced when there is large uncertainty about the prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients in hospitals are often continuously monitored by the medical personnel, who collect data about the patients&amp;rsquo; demographics, vital signs and lab test results. In this project, forecasts are made on the future occurrence of medical events such as sepsis, future orders of medical tests, as well as the evolution of key vital signs of patients in the remainder of their stay, based on data available from their first 12 recorded hours of stay. Accurate predictions could potentially help in resource planning and workflow management in hospitals. To address the challenges of missing features and imbalance classification, simple imputer, standard scaler, and histogram-based gradient boosting classification tree are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to estimate the full state of a boat crossing a windy lake. The control inputs to the boat are the thrust command and the rudder command. The boat produces thrust in the longitudinal direction and is affected by hydrodynamic and aerodynamic drag. As a result, the state evolution of the boat is governed by a nonlinear continuous-time system dynamics. The boat receives position and orientation measurements from external stations affected by Gaussian noise corruption. In this project, a Hybrid Extended Kalman Filter is employed to estimate the full state of the boat given the nonlinear dynamics and noisy observations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to track the state of a mobile robot, which moves in a closed room with a partially known contour. A distance sensor is mounted on the robot, pointing in the same direction as the robot is heading. This sensor measures the distance between the robot and the first opposing wall straight in front of the robot. The robot is controlled with a known input, which prevents the robot from driving into any wall. In this project, a Particle Filter is employed to estimate the location and heading of the robot, as well as the offset of an uncertain wall from its nominal position given the nonlinear dynamics and noisy observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of emergent behavior. The complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents adhering to a set of simple rules. In this project, the rules applied in the simplest Boids world including free fall, separation, alignment, cohesion, leading, circular, collision avoidance, collaboration and adversary are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, the dynamics of a cube projectile are simulated using the equations of motion for rigid bodies. The explicit Euler method is used to perform numerical integration in the discretized system dynamics, where the growth of simulation rate (or the decrease of time step) results in a more precise approximation to the continuous setting. However, the total energy of the system increases when the explicit Euler method is applied, which causes an unstable simulation of spring objects. To this end, the implicit Euler method is applied. Finally, impulse-based collision simulation logic for restitutional contact is implemented to constitute the simulation of rigid bodies when touching a surface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inverse kinematics problem of legged systems is described as determining the generalized coordinate vector given the desired end effector target position. An inverse kinematics problem can be formulated as an optimization problem. In this project, the gradient-descent method, Newton&amp;rsquo;s method, and the Gauss-Newton method are used to solve the optimization problem, with a derivation of the Jacobian matrix of the feet point dynamics. A trajectory planning method is implemented to track a target base trajectory on both flat and bumpy terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to walk through the necessary algorithmic components of developing a wheeled mobile robot. For locomotion, a closed-loop motion controller is implemented to regulate wheel velocities. For perception, linear fitting and extraction from laser scans using the split-and-merge approach are used for landmark-based localization against a known map in a line-based Extended Kalman Filter framework. In addition, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is implemented for autonomous map building while exploring the environment. Finally, motion planning algorithms are applied including Dijkstra’s algorithm for computing a navigation function based on a static map of the environment, and the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) for online planning, taking into account both static and dynamic obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, the overall system is a simulation of a soft bar glued to handles. This includes finite elements (triangles) to model the bar itself and additional spring terms to model the interface between the bar and the handles. The displacement of the mesh elements is computed by minimizing the total energy of the static system. In addition, the mesh is controlled with two handles that define planar translations and orientations of the glued points. In this setting, the optimal control signal that brings the deformed position as close as possible to the target position is obtained using the inverse kinematics method. The energy density of a neo-Hookean triangle element is used in computing the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, trajectory optimization methods are compared in a target-reaching task, where direct shooting optimizes over the control only whereas direct transcription enforces physics as a constraint and simultaneously optimizes over the control and the state. Finally, an orbit tracking problem is solved within a limited time of actuation by employing model predictive control and solving the optimization problem with longer horizons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to explore the nonlinear full position control of quadrotor systems and investigate the applicability of dynamics linearization. Quadrotors are under-actuated systems where not all states are independently controllable. When developing the control algorithms, it is generally assumed that the system operates at low speeds. In this setting, only the dominating aerodynamic forces are considered and linearization around small attitude angles (roll and pitch) is employed such that linear inputs are decoupled. In this project, control strategy with the nonlinear system dynamics is investigated to explore state space where linearized control is not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to regulate the temperature of a vaccination center. The center offers two types of vaccines, each stored in a separate freezer as the required storage temperatures are different and allowed only in a certain range. The actual temperatures of the freezers are constantly affected by the environment outside. In this project, a temperature controller for a heating unit is designed to track the desired temperatures and satisfy the safety constraints at all times. A variety of MPC controllers are implemented to deal with different problem settings including unconstrained optimal control, closed-loop state and input constraint satisfaction, soft constraints, offset-free control, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to deliver a package with a drone as quickly as possible. To achieve this, the drone must first fly to a pick-up station to collect a package and then reach a delivery station to discharge it. Along the way, the drone must avoid hazards such as trees or angry residents who try to shoot it down. In this project, the optimal policy minimizing the expected number of time steps required to successfully deliver a package is obtained by using value iteration, policy iteration and linear programming algorithms in a discrete infinite horizon setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensional (3D) printing is classified as a revolutionary, manufacturing technology. As the most abundant natural polymer, cellulose and its many derivatives have been widely studied for many applications. The combination of 3D printable polymers with cellulose-based feedstocks is therefore of critical interest. This review highlights many studies on 3D printing applications of plant-derived cellulose and its derivatives. Potential materials include cellulose ethers/esters, microcrystalline cellulose, nanocellulose materials, and other products. Focus will be placed on their roles and functions in 3D printing processes and the performance of the resultant printed objects. A feasible methodology to compose wood fiber reinforced composites as the filament material is developed. The outlook for future work is also provided, to underscore critical issues and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
