A variety of MPC controllers are implemented to deal with different problem settings including unconstrained optimal control, closed-loop state and input constraint satisfaction, soft constraints, offset-free control, etc.\n","date":1614470400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614470400,"objectID":"d2394acd6aed923e186d43b5bc78bfb1","permalink":"https://tutunarsl.github.io/project/eth-mpc/","publishdate":"2021-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/eth-mpc/","section":"project","summary":"Regulating continuous-time linear systems with a variety of Model Predictive Control (MPC) controllers.","tags":["Classic Control"],"title":"Model Predictive Control for Vaccination Center Climate Regulation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Description The objective of the project is to deliver a package with a drone as quickly as possible.

As the most abundant natural polymer, cellulose and its many derivatives have been widely studied for many applications. The combination of 3D printable polymers with cellulose-based feedstocks is therefore of critical interest. This review highlights many studies on 3D printing applications of plant-derived cellulose and its derivatives. Potential materials include cellulose ethers/esters, microcrystalline cellulose, nanocellulose materials, and other products. Focus will be placed on their roles and functions in 3D printing processes and the performance of the resultant printed objects. A feasible methodology to compose wood fiber reinforced composites as the filament material is developed. The outlook for future work is also provided, to underscore critical issues and opportunities.\n","date":1538265600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538265600,"objectID":"c1fc3ea80605548dc757c24840778767","permalink":"https://tutunarsl.github.io/project/mcgill/","publishdate":"2018-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mcgill/","section":"project","summary":"Reinforcing mechanical properties of 3D printing materials by affiliating pulverized wood particles with melted polymer through a novel process of extrusion.","tags":["Mechatronics"],"title":"Design and 3D Printing of Lightweight Advanced Energy Harvesters Made of Smart Materials","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6c1ee091b2428b08266365e5f7664df8","permalink":"https://tutunarsl.github.io/platform/alma/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/platform/alma/","section":"platform","summary":"ALMA is equipped with a robotic arm designed for articulated locomotion and manipulation.","tags":null,"title":"ALMA","type":"platform"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e31d39a63762f8ba65e508d0a4cd543c","permalink":"https://tutunarsl.github.io/platform/anymal/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/platform/anymal/","section":"platform","summary":"ANYmal is optimized for automated industrial inspection tasks with a wide range of sensors.","tags":null,"title":"ANYmal C","type":"platform"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"af9f0920b83adf162ffc05b7fb975c69","permalink":"https://tutunarsl.github.io/platform/pleurobot/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/platform/pleurobot/","section":"platform","summary":"Pleurobot is a salamander-like robot that is designed to help in search and rescue operations with amphibious capability.","tags":null,"title":"Pleurobot","type":"platform"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7dc6c584cb5e17f44a17fa2fd81bb098","permalink":"https://tutunarsl.github.io/platform/solo/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/platform/solo/","section":"platform","summary":"Solo is an open-source light-weight research quadruped robot that allows highly dynamic actuations.","tags":null,"title":"Solo 8","type":"platform"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ce42e8723d9afb2e656d55bdb7c29630","permalink":"https://tutunarsl.github.io/platform/spot/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/platform/spot/","section":"platform","summary":"Spot is an agile mobile robot that navigates complex terrains for automated routine inspection and data capture.","tags":null,"title":"Spot","type":"platform"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e0102e370edff5ff611a16b4a8cdf825","permalink":"https://tutunarsl.github.io/platform/supermegabot/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/platform/supermegabot/","section":"platform","summary":"SuperMegaBot is a 4-wheeled mobile robot for automonous site inspection and artifact detection.","tags":null,"title":"SuperMegaBot","type":"platform"}]
